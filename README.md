# SQL-PROJECT-ON-LIBRARY-MANAGEMENT-DATABASE
This library management system is a SQL-based solution for tracking books, users, and transactions. The system uses SQL to manage the database and provide functionality such as book checkout, book return, and book search.

The system includes tables for books and users, as well as a transactions table to track book checkouts and returns. The books table contains fields for book title, author, borrowers, and quantity. The users table includes fields for name, email, and password. The transactions table tracks which user checked out which book and when, as well as when the book was returned.

In addition to the basic database tables, the system includes views to display data in a user-friendly format. The library_books view displays all books in the library, while the user_transactions view shows a user's current book transactions.

The system can be used to manage book inventory in a library, bookstore, or other setting. To use the system, users can interact with the SQL database directly or through a front-end application.

Overall, this library management system is a powerful and flexible solution for managing books and users using SQL. With its comprehensive data model and user-friendly views, it is an ideal choice for any organization looking to keep track of their books and borrowers.
